# Changelog

All notable changes to `@bymax-one/nest-telemetry` are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

The `release.yml` workflow extracts the section matching the pushed `vX.Y.Z` tag
as the GitHub Release body, so each released version needs a matching `## [X.Y.Z]`
heading here.

## [1.0.0] - Unreleased

First release.

### Added

- **`.`**: `startTelemetry(options)` assembles the OpenTelemetry SDK from the host's options and the
  standard `OTEL_*` variables and returns a handle; `shutdownTelemetry()` drains it; `ignorePaths(patterns)`
  builds the incoming-request predicate; `DEFAULT_REDACTED_QUERY_PARAMS`. The SDK part imports no
  `@nestjs/*` package.
- **`./register`**: a zero-config preload for `node --import`. It registers the OpenTelemetry loader
  hook so native ES modules are instrumented, starts the SDK from the standard variables and flushes on
  a natural exit. A failed start or hook is a warning, never a failed boot. Its CommonJS entry refuses to
  load and names `node --import`.
- **`./nest`**: `TelemetryModule` and `TelemetryShutdownHook` flush the SDK when the application closes.
  A failed flush never rejects and is reported under the stable key `TRACING_FLUSH_FAILED`, through the
  structured logger bound to `TELEMETRY_LOGGER` or the Nest logger.
- **Redaction on by default**: `url.query`, `url.full`, `http.url` and `http.target` on every span; a
  credential-parameter list for outgoing request URLs that a host can add to and not replace; Redis
  command arguments, `EVAL` payloads included; the process command line in the exported resource. Each
  has one explicit `unsafe` off switch that emits a `SecurityWarning`. `instrumentations.overrides`
  cannot undo a layer.
- **Zero cost when disabled**: a boot with `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED=true` registers no hook and loads no
  OpenTelemetry package, `@opentelemetry/api` included.
- One module reads the environment. `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` overrides the `serviceName` option, and
  `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED=true` always disables.
- Warnings with stable codes: `BYMAX_TELEMETRY_UNSAFE_REDACTION_DISABLED`,
  `BYMAX_TELEMETRY_SERVICE_NAME_MISSING`, `BYMAX_TELEMETRY_ESM_HOOK_UNAVAILABLE`,
  `BYMAX_TELEMETRY_START_FAILED`.
- Optional peers: `@opentelemetry/api`, `sdk-node`, `sdk-trace`, `resources`, `exporter-trace-otlp-http`,
  `auto-instrumentations-node`, `instrumentation`, and `@nestjs/common`, `@nestjs/core`,
  `reflect-metadata`, `rxjs` for `./nest`.
- Verification from the packed tarball: real `node --import` processes in a CommonJS and a native-ESM
  application, with planted secrets absent from the exported body and four negative controls.
